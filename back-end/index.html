        <h2>Overview of Our Solution</h2>
        <h3>We used our chrome extension to search our page for an ingredients section, and then we took in the data  of each ingredient, including the amount, and passed it into our database where we search for viable alternatives for that ingredient. We created a Flask API to communicate between our backend and frontend. Our extension takes in the Carbon emission data of the ingredient and suggests a food that is similar but with lower carbon emissions so that users can try to be more mindful of where their food comes from.</h3>
